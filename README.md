# User-Deactivation
On this example we are creating an Schedulable and Batch Apex class with Custom Metadata Type ( Deactivate Time --> Field (Deactivate Day/Number).
If the users have not been loged in period of long time, they will be deactive.
We create Custom Metadata Type here because System Admin can change time period without coding!
